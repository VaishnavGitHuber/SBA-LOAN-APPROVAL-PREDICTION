# SBA-LOAN-APPROVAL-PREDICTION
In this project, we have analysed and predicted loan approval status based on various parameters for the Small Business Administration (SBA). We use various python libraries to preprocess the dataset, and the dataset was imported from kaggle. The initial pre-processing of the dataset was inspired from Kevin Miller. Further model training was performed into predicting the best result for the loan approval.
